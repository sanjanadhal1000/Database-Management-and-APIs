⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTE ON MODULE UPDATE

The Advanced Machine Learning tasks (Random Forest, XGBoost) present in 
Day 1–Day 3 were completed when Month 3 initially covered Advanced ML topics.

After a platform update, Month 3 was revised to "Database Management & APIs".
The Weather Data Pipeline project (from Day 4 onward) follows the updated 
curriculum.
