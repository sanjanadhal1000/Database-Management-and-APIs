DAY 4 – PROJECT UNDERSTANDING & SCHEMA DESIGN
Weather Data Pipeline System

1. PROJECT OVERVIEW
The Weather Data Pipeline is an end-to-end data engineering system that:
- Extracts real-time weather data from OpenWeatherMap API
- Transforms and cleans the data
- Loads it into a relational SQLite database
- Supports historical analysis, reporting, and alerts

2. DATABASE DESIGN GOALS
- Store structured and historical weather data
- Avoid data redundancy using normalization
- Support analytical queries (average temperature, trends)
- Track pipeline execution and failures

3. TABLE DESCRIPTIONS

A. cities
Purpose:
Stores static information about cities being tracked.

Columns:
- city_id: Primary key, unique city identifier
- city_name: Name of the city
- country: Country name or code
- latitude, longitude: Geographic coordinates
- created_at: Timestamp when city was added

Why separate table?
- Avoid repeating city details for every weather record
- Enables normalization (3NF)

B. weather_data
Purpose:
Stores time-series weather observations.

Columns:
- record_id: Primary key
- city_id: Foreign key linking to cities table
- timestamp: Date and time of weather observation
- temperature_c: Temperature in Celsius
- humidity: Humidity percentage
- pressure_hpa: Atmospheric pressure
- wind_speed_mps: Wind speed in meters per second
- weather_condition: Text description (clear, cloudy, rain)

Relationship:
- Many weather records belong to one city
- One-to-many relationship between cities and weather_data

C. pipeline_logs
Purpose:
Tracks ETL pipeline execution status for monitoring and debugging.

Columns:
- log_id: Primary key
- run_time: When pipeline ran
- status: SUCCESS / FAILED
- message: Error or success message

4. NORMALIZATION
- 1NF: Atomic columns, no repeating groups
- 2NF: No partial dependency (weather depends on city_id)
- 3NF: City details stored separately from weather data

5. ER RELATIONSHIP (TEXTUAL)
cities (1) -------- (many) weather_data
pipeline_logs is independent

6. FUTURE EXTENSIONS
- Add users table for access control
- Add alerts table for threshold breaches
- Index timestamp column for faster queries
